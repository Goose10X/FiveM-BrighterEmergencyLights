# FiveM-BrighterEmergencyLights
Brighter Emergency Lights for FiveM

This is NOT a graphics mod.
This is a .dat text file that adjusts the GTA lighting settings.
This visualsetting.dat file was custom adjusted by Goose10X to enhance the emergency lighting settings for day and night in FiveM.

# How to install
• Download the visualsetting.dat file
• Right click your orange FiveM icon on your desktop and select open file location.
• Then click FiveM Application Data > Citizen > Common > Data 
• Copy and Paste (or drag and drop) the visualsettings.dat file into the Data folder.
• The file location might look something like this: C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\FiveM\FiveM.app\citizen\common\data
• Close the folder and you're all set. Restart FiveM and enjoy the new brighter and better emergency lights.
